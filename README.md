# ict-gallery
401 individual code test - gallery

This test app makes it possible for the user to create a series of mini galleries, each with multiple links.

When submitted, the links are displayed as images.

The server.js is for the backend, and runs on port 3000 by default.

The clientserver.js is for the front end, and runs on port 5000 by default.

Written with node version 4.2.3, your milage may vary.

Tests are mocha at root, or run the "gulp webpack:test" command, then karma start. That will do the client side tests.
